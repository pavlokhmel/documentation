Discussion (5 minutes):
Frequently, research problems that use computing can outgrow the capabilities of the desktop or laptop computer where they started:
:::</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Image processing of large images, with multiple processing steps, quickly exceeds the RAM of regular computers. This is especially true when additional dimensions are added, such as time lapse, or additional channels/colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, working with images as input. Hyper-parameter search / tuning networks. Could only train on top layers.</p></li>
<li><p>bioinformatics analyses</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bioinformatic analysis, from large sample set of metagenome sequences to abundance table stage.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Image processing of radiographs, just starting</p></li>
<li><p>Molecular dynamics simulations</p></li>
<li><p>Bioinformatic analyses /de novo assembly of bacterial isolates and phylogenetic analyses</p></li>
<li><p>Climate simulation / weather forecast</p></li>
<li><p>Gene annotation of NGS data, especially PCR error correction taking up a lot of RAM</p></li>
<li><p>Large datasets in psychology / neuroscience</p></li>
<li><p>Simulations with lots of parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Bayesian models using MCMC</p></li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" role="doc-backlink">Your questions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#your-questions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What are the advantages of faster I/O capacity, other than reading and writing data more quickly (which might happen only at the beginning or end of a script, so may not be a huge deal)?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The I/O capacity is in many cases shared with several users.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also not always the case that this is only done at start and end of a script. Quite a few workloads needs to access data during execution, and a few, quite a lot.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Not a question, but about the story about using HPC without knowing to do so. I would hope the system would be more like that. Not necessary to know Unix and all that. Hide some of the complexity from users and let them concentrate on data and algorithms.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Yes, more and more the access is getting like that with web-interfaces and ways to construct your workflows and jobs using drop-down menus etc. Examples are Galaxy portal, OnDemand portal and many more</p></li>
<li><p>Thank you, will we learn about those in this course?</p></li>
<li><p>No, unfortunately, but this will definitely come at some point, it is a bit new at the moment, but later tutorials will be expanded with this type of things</p></li>
<li><p>If you are interested in Galaxy, there is a self-paced community course (or what to call it) in May: https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>at the end of yesterday lecture, the lecturer mentioned two software to connect to hpc i think, could you please repeat the name again. Thanks</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>were these graphical tools? (sorry I wasn’t here yesterday …)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>yes they were related to GUI, but both also offers terminal capabilities. And support standard ssh.</p></li>
<li><p>X2Go: https://documentation.sigma2.no/getting_started/remote-desktop.html?highlight=x2go</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Studio Code: https://documentation.sigma2.no/code_development/guides/vs_code/connect_to_server.html?highlight=visual%20studio%20code</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perfect so they are similar to remote desktop?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes they are remote desktop also. X2Go is our remote desktop solution that we support. Yes</p></li>
<li><p>VS code is a code editor, and when connecting to HPC, you can access all your files as if they were on your computer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>could you please demonstrate X2GO once ? i have tried myself but i think it is not working or at least i did not recognize how it is working.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Is it okay to be in login-1.FRAM?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Yes it is perfectly fine. fram.sigma2.no is a generic portal that directs you to different login entries depending on workload. We currently have more than one, since there are many users. login-1.fram is the name of 1 of the login nodes, login-2.fram is the name of another. You may also log in using user&#64;login-1.fram.sigma2.no if you need to go to a specific log in server (or 2, 3 etc).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>where can the server (hash) key be verified (displayed on first login)?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>https://documentation.sigma2.no/getting_started/fingerprints.html</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>On <a class="reference external" href="https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/hpc-intro/_images/hpc.svg">this image</a>, is it possible to identify a single node? Is it one unit on a rack? Is it a whole rack?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>one unit on a rack. what I am unsure about is whether one of the “pizza boxes” (the 2-3 cm high metal things) host 1 node or more than 1 node.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What you refer to is probably the single hight, this contains two compute servers, typically also called nodes. Due to technical reasons we store two and two on each level. Each node for our machines mostly contains two CPU’s with a number of core units - ranging from 16/cpu on Fram to 64/cpu on Betzy.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>should I go down and take a picture of a node on fram?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that would be nice. we could also put it into the documentation. :+1:</p></li>
<li><p>ØT: On my way (not available for breakout rooms)</p></li>
<li><p>Picture of a rack in fram</p></li>
<li><p>Each one contains 6 chassis</p></li>
<li><p><img alt="" src="../../../_images/chassis_fram.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>a chassis</p></li>
<li><p>Each containing 6 blades</p></li>
<li><p><img alt="" src="../../../_images/blade_fram.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>a blade</p></li>
<li><p>Each containing 2 nodes</p></li>
<li><p><img alt="" src="../../../_images/insidenode_fram.png" /></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>thanks for posting these!</p></li>
<li><p>This was very cool to see!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Do you pay for using the “login node” or only the “working node”?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The cpu-time is calculated from the actual analysis job you submit via the batch system. So that is the time that will be accounted towards your project quota.</p></li>
<li><p>in short: for the compute node, not for the CPU time spent on login node. but this does not mean we should compute on login node :-)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Are all servers in Fram physically located in the same room? What about Fox, Saga, Betzy?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the compute resources: yes</p></li>
<li><p>this is also true for the other clusters. one reason why a compute cluster is typically in one room and not spread across several cities is that the high-speed network (“interconnect”) which connects the compute nodes, puts a limitation on the length of cables.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I dont understand the message I get after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sinfo</span></code> command in the terminal. Could you explain?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it gives us an overview over the available queues (or partitions) (“normal”, “optimist”, “bigmem”, …) and a mapping between the queues and node names (“c3-1”, “c2-10”, …) and their status (“idle”, “drain”, “alloc”, …)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>maybe the actual information it gives is more useful to those maintaining the system than to those using the system</p></li>
<li><p>The information will be different depending on what system you are on, so SAGA, FRAM, Betzy will have somewhat different queues and specifications</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>yes, same concept</p></li>

<li><p>My example_job.sh doesn’t want to execute, it says permission denied. I made it executable. Any tips? :)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>if you like you can post the full path to the example script and I can look as staff (I will then also redact the path away again)</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to run it like e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./example-job.sh</span></code> the dot and / if you are in the same folder</p></li>
<li><p>Run pwd to get path</p>
<ul>
<li><p>path: (redacted path)</p></li>
<li><p>thanks! looking …</p></li>
<li><p>solution: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">+x</span> <span class="pre">example_job.sh</span></code> (to make it executable)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>but I did that (several times lol)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>how did you try to run it, and what does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> show you? See how to do this in the day 0 course: https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/unix-for-hpc/episodes/scripting.html</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>currently the file is not executable</p>
<ul>
<li><p>now it is executable</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>So it is the chmod +x that gives you the permission denied?</p></li>
<li><p>I called this: chmod -x example_job.sh</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(See also below) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-x</span></code> removes the executable “flag” (information)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>then: ./example_job.sh</p></li>
<li><p>it’s the script execution that gives me the permission denied error</p></li>
<li><p>I made it executable now. Try to run it again <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./example_job.sh</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>thanks it works now, but it doesn’t really explain why my chmod didn’t work?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No, it does not… I have to admit, I have not seen this problem before… You should have the right to make something executable in your own home folder..</p></li>
<li><p>I have created a file named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_permission.sh</span></code> in your home folder, could you try to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">+x</span> <span class="pre">test_permission.sh</span></code>?</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll try again with another script. Yeah, the chmod seems not to work, though it gives no error or warning. Okay got it now, the problem was that I used “-x” for “+x” Sorry!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>yes, + and - will do what you think. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">-x</span> <span class="pre">file</span></code> would remove eXecute permission from a file, + adds it</p></li>

<li><p>I only see nn9987k</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>hopefully you can use this quota for the exercise. in other words: nothing to worry about</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What’s the difference between projects ending in “k” and those ending in “o” (just curious)?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>my understanding is that all compute projects normally end in “k” but optimist quotas end with “o” (these can only be used on “optimist” queue?)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Adding details to a command seems to come with a - (eg -l or -n). What does – indicate?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>many commands use one dash for short options and two dashes for long options (long meaning: option is written out). example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-A</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--account</span></code> do the same thing</p></li>
<li><p>See Day 0 information: for instance https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/unix-for-hpc/episodes/moving-around.html and also the cheat-sheet: https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/unix-for-hpc/cheat-sheet.html</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neither of these mention the – (other than having to override the missing certificate), but the other explanations in the responses here answer my question.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ok, does it not say explicitly, at least it mentions options and shows the options using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code>  - but good that you understand it now! :)</p></li>
<li><p>It is typical syntax of UNIX (and probably also Windows) commands, that you use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--</span></code> to give options to the command</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Interesting for customization of jobs:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>Is it possible to add the time units in the documentation somewhere, as in hh:mm:ss ?</p></li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>why does all the example files end with .sh? would it end with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> if it was a python file?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the ending here only helps us humans to anticipate what is inside the file. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.sh</span></code> communicates to me that there will probably be a shell script inside. but for the cluster it does not matter. I could call it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.run</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.batch</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.job</span></code> and it would still work. If it was a Python file, it would be good to call it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">something.py</span></code>, again to communicate expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>okay, so it does not specify “what language” to read the script in?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>correct. but look at the first line inside the file that starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!</span></code>: this one tells the shell which interpreter to use to interpret what follows. if that was a Python script, it would contain <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!/usr/bin/env</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Thanks!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a bit more explanation (hopefully more helping than confusing): I can run a bash script like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span> <span class="pre">somescript</span></code> or like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./somescript</span></code> - in the latter case the shell does not know yet what language to use and then it will look at the so-called “shebang” line (the line starting with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!</span></code>). in other words, if I run a Python script like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">somescript.py</span></code>, then it will NOT use the “shebang” line.</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I am unsure how to estimate 1)the time a job needs and 2)how much CPU hours it will cost. Do you have some resources for that?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>this is a great question. it typically requires some calibration. what I personally like to use is to start from a small example and grow it to the real example. often I can extrapolate from the smaller example towards the real example. but it often requires trial and error. for the first run I am often more generous and then after the first run I know how much time the other runs will use - was this helpful?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes, thanks! I find myself being “scared” to try, what happens if we run out of resources on the project account? Will the job stop or will it continue running and then we get a huge bill?</p></li>
<li><p>You will only be billed for the actual amount of cpu-hours spent. So the “only” bad thing about specifying too long time is that 1) it may take longer you your job to start and 2) it prevents SLURM from doing a good job allocating other jobs since maybe another that that was short could have fitted onto that node, if the time you specified was shorter (and correct).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Can results from a terminated project (which exceeded its time limit) still be accessed, for example at a shared storage area?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We have a shared storage system for all nodes. So, if you save something to a file, it will be available even if the job crashes. But you will have to actually save it to a file. Results in memory will be gone.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a rather tricky and actually quite advanced question: Depends a bit on your job-setup. Have a look at the run script example on our main documentation, for instance the gaussian run script example under application support to see a solution to keep the files even if the job dies prematurely.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Link to main documentation: https://documentation.sigma2.no/</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This one? https://documentation.sigma2.no/software/application_guides/gaussian/gaussian_job_example.html</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Will the shared storage system be covered in this course, or should I refer to the main documentation?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Is a possibility to use cpus from two or more projects for our job? And if yes how we command this in SBATCH?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>to my knowledge: no. a job will use one account</p></li>
<li><p>Depends a bit what you mean by project. But as a compute project with allocated compute resources/CPU hrs - the answer above holds.
-Yes, I mean an account.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How do you know what %j means? What would the source to look for all the combinations such as %a or %A.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can get that details from SLURM sbatch manual</p>
<ul>
<li><p>https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Is it possible to add a timestamp? I cannot find that in the doc.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That you need to use UNIX tricks to fabricate a file name</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filename=$(date</span> <span class="pre">+&quot;%m-%d-%H-%M&quot;)&quot;-somename.txt&quot;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>The above variable <em>filename</em> would then contain the value 04-19-11-17-somename.txt</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There is a part on running interactive jobs in the end of the Scheduling Jobs lesson. Is this to use with for example Jupyter for debugging? I am still in an early phase and my Python programs only give me a lot of errors, so I cannot submit them as scripts yet.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Thank you for pointing it out. Will show this after the exercises</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If one wanted to submit 10 or 20 calculations which differ in a file name but not in the ending (file suffix), how can one do that? assuming that the calculations have same resource requirements but only differ in some calculation parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one option is Slurm job arrays where you can write one job script but inside the job script, Slurm will define an index number for each job which one can use but the index is numeric. this way one can inside the job refer to files. <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html">Slurm Array jobs</a></p></li>
<li><p>alternative: one (bash) script (but does not have to be bash) which iterates over the files and for each submits a job script. (I will post here an actual example in a moment … just thinking about how to not make this confusing):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“outside” script:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin env bash</span>

</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>however, disadvantage of this approach is that I now need to write many similar job scripts. But there is a better way to avoid that. In this example one “outside” script generates 3 scripts, each 1 minute long, and submits them all at the same time.</p></li>

<li><p>There is also the option to write a job script generator which iterates on many different file names. This is quit widely in computational chemistry. However, this requires a somewhat more advanced insight in linux power tools/scripting. We may provide example, but it would be on your own risk type offer.</p></li>
<li><p>using piping, you can generate the list of input parameters you need and create a file that has that list. As the array job will get its input index, you can use this index to look up in the file what filename that exact job is supposed to use.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>both have the same effect. on the command line it can be useful for quick testing. but after the quick testing I always prefer to put this rather into the script because then when I come back to my job script 6 months later, I know what I actually did.

<li><p>I missed a comment early on. Is the reason for using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsync</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scp</span></code> is because the former is much faster or is the latter not supported on Sigma2?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is supported, just faster and more safe to use - rsync typically picks up where it left if you lose connection, and it also just updates the files that are actually changed, while scp copied files no matter if they are changed or not (changed with respect to the state on the remote site)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>when I have used rsync previously, rsync says “not all files were transferred” (or something like that). This only happens to a few of the files i transfer. Is there something that may be cause by the rsync? Does it not work with all file types? Would it help to zip beforehand?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>zip beforehand should not be needed. I am wondering whether the information could mean that rsync did not transfer all files since it did not need to? It does not transfer files which are already there. It looks at file size and time stamps and can also consider checksums. But I am not sure about my answer. I haven’t seen the error you describe, yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>based on what Øystein just said: I am transferring a folder, do I need to specify -r when transferring a folder to get all files?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> is used to tell rsync that you should consider files in folders and subfolders - in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scp</span></code> () it would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>ah yes</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>according to my limited knowledge, no. example for transferring files and folders: https://documentation.sigma2.no/files_storage/file_transfer.html#transferring-files-between-your-computer-and-a-compute-cluster-or-storage-resource</p></li>

<li><p>Som you dont need to be logged into FRAM to move something to FRAM?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>that’s right. you still need to authenticate, though. If you use SSH keys, then the authentication can happen “under the hood” and it can look like that you can transfer files without providing a password.</p></li>

<li><p>my username for this course is …&#64;login-3 and not ..&#64;sigma2.no, should i specify the whole “email” or just what comes before the &#64;?
