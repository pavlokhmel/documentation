# User communities

Here you will find a survey of other users operating within domains and/or using software that might be interesting to you.

We provide this in order to make it easier for users, especially new, to get in contact with established communities 
that can offer collaborations, useful discussions, solutions to specific challenges, joint training and so forth. We strongly
advice users to get in contact with others using the same software or within the same field and furthermore utilize that network
when you encounter problems you believe others might have encountered before.

All listed users have given consent to be present on this page.

If you see yourself and want to update the information, please {ref}`contact us <support-line>`.
