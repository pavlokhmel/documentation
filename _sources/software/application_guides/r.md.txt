## How to install packages
There might be some packages missing in the R module we have installed or may be you need a different
version than what we have. In that case you could install the packages yourself. For example,
following is the procedure to install the package called XYZ by the user *user1* on  SAGA. 
Please Please remember to use your username instead of *user1*

 -  Login to saga
 -  Load the module

```
        [user1@login-1.SAGA ~]$ module restore
        [user1@login-1.SAGA ~]$ module load R/4.0.0-foss-2020a
        [user1@login-1.SAGA ~]$ mkdir /cluster/home/user1/R
        [user1@login-1.SAGA ~]$ R
```

 - Use the R prompt to install the package

```
      #Set the location for the packages to be installed
      > .libPaths("/cluster/home/user1/R")
      #install the package
      >  install.packages("XYX", repo="cran.uib.no")
      #Check if the package can be  loaded
      > library(XYZ)
```

 - How to use an installed package
   After installing, everytime the packages needed to be accessed
   The `.libPaths("/cluster/home/user1/R")` setting should be done.
   When submitting R Script as a job, the `.libPath("/cluster/home/user1/R")` should be
   specified before calling the package.
