# Access and login


## Getting access

To gain access to the storage services, a formal application is required. The
process is explained at the
[How to apply for a user account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account)
page.

Users must be registered and authorised by the project responsible
before getting access.

To access or transfer data, we recommend to use `ssh` or
`rsync`. More details on our page about {ref}`file-transfer`.

The NIRD can be accessed via the following address

```console
login.nird.sigma2.no
```

The login credentials are the same as for the old NIRD.

You will be logged into your home area `/nird/home/$USERHOME`


```{note}
You as user are expected to migrate data from the old $HOME folder to the 
new $HOME folder by yourself.  Please see {ref}`access to old NIRD` session
on how to do it.
```

## Software access

Software can be accessed as module just like on HPCs. Please see the {ref}`module-scheme` for details.

```{warning}
Module command is not yet stable. Please report any issue encountered to support line, 
contact **[support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no)**.

```
In addition a number of software can be accessed via command line.
